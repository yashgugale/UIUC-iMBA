16:24:56 From  Morgan Schwenn  to  Everyone:
	this reminds me of the new Netflix documentary 14 peaks (really interesting from a leadership & teams point) & Awesome movie!
16:25:09 From  Christopher Dodd  to  Everyone:
	@morgan agree!
16:38:53 From  Emily Hamilton  to  Everyone:
	We talked about 14 peaks, too!
16:39:30 From  Kamran Amini  to  Everyone:
	Suggested by Chris: 14 peaks in Netflix
16:39:36 From  Saravanen Marimuthu  to  Everyone:
	Its on my watchlist. Have to watch it soon
16:41:59 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	Group 7 - Hierarchy is necessary evil, takes care of obstacles/hurdles for the team (provide cover from politics and noise so team can be successful)
16:42:12 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	I like how students are connecting this question to the content on Coursera about Decision Making. 
16:42:32 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	‚ÄúNecessary evil‚Äù - interesting choice of phrase to capture both costs and benefits
16:42:36 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	+1 Prof Keating
16:43:11 From  George Illaszewicz  to  Everyone:
	hierarchy doesn't imply that the person making the decisions is the most knowledgeable or competent
16:43:19 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	+1 George
16:43:31 From  Rita Hokstad  to  Everyone:
	+1 George
16:43:32 From  William Rodgers  to  Everyone:
	Military on the battlefield with hierarchy.
16:43:34 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	+1 George - and it reminds me how important it is - when we are in power - to be thoughtful about our decisions
16:43:51 From  Saurabh Mishra  to  Everyone:
	There should be a bottom line for success, i.e. if this happens whole team fails. in this case should have been that no one dies
16:44:01 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Military is an interesting context and one in which leadership has been extensively studied for exactly that reason
16:44:04 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	Many times, Hierarchy just means someone has more pieces of paper (speaking from the science fields).
16:44:20 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	"Necessary evil" is an ethic problem that can't be really implemented in organizational environment without big negative input on the whole goal
16:44:21 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	Group 7 - In absence of hierarchy, flat teams might loose valuable time in making the decision as no one is responsible to make a quick decision in difficult situations
16:44:30 From  Sam Ng  to  Everyone:
	Coursera mentioned that managers often overestimate their ability to make high-quality decision without the input of others
16:44:43 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	Great connection @Sam. 
16:44:58 From  Nilesh Kumar  to  Everyone:
	Can get inputs from all, but eventually somebody has to make a collective call and move in one direction and so hierarchy as 'necessary evil ' is required.
16:45:00 From  Kamran Amini  to  Everyone:
	hierarchy tends NOT to generate a wide range of information. "The more complex the task, the more likely we are to make a mistake or miss something critical"
16:45:34 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	Well for the military a leadership structure in combat situations, since the group has to be provided information from on person. If to many people giving orders, it could lead to deaths. The problem is many are promoted with out the real skills needed to lead and so that leads to very bad hierarchy structures in the military.
16:45:48 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	In the readings for this Module, we also learned that communicating a common goal/vision is among the most valuable leadership competency. 
16:45:49 From  Ahmed Alshaer  to  Everyone:
	The type of business is playing an important factor
16:45:59 From  Mee-Hyoe Koo  to  Everyone:
	Professor -- in the context of hierarchical decision making the decision on behalf of 'organizational good' sometimes the morality and 'was it the right decision as a human being' gets questioned. How does the leader justify the 'organizational good' decision when it dilutes and undermines the 'was it an ethical decision as a human being'?
16:46:00 From  Don Van Dyke  to  Everyone:
	Apologies all. Technical difficulties with Canvas live sessions login has just been resolved.
16:46:01 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	+1 Deric
16:46:01 From  Darrell Kisselburgh  to  Everyone:
	Communication and "buy in" on the strategy is key along with defined roles in the hierarchy.
16:46:05 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	Also cultural, where leadership is more exclusive in making decision without much inclusion and participation of the team
16:46:07 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Other areas like that - emergency rooms
16:46:14 From  Morgan Schwenn  to  Everyone:
	we can have hierarchy & inclusive decision making, but the decision still needs to be made
16:46:16 From  William Rodgers  to  Everyone:
	Can too many voices in the decision and concern cause no action to be taken?
16:46:25 From  Chandran Ramasamy Sadasivam  to  Everyone:
	in Decentralized team, more appropriate decisions at each level.
16:46:32 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	William - good question - what‚Äôs your experience?
16:47:03 From  Alexandra Duston  to  Everyone:
	Interesting, we also mentioned the military structure in our group. We also discussed the value of leadership and how a leader with a better track record in reaching the summit and expense of casualties would be a key factor is choosing which leader to join on the journey.
16:47:14 From  William Rodgers  to  Everyone:
	@Elizabeth...my background in military, business, coaching youth sports, and leading young Cub Scouts
16:47:17 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	@William, absolutely. You can't proceed with project if team's opinion split
16:47:24 From  Brian Leung  to  Everyone:
	the difficult decision the leaders need to make is risk tolerance - climbing is dangerous to begin with and everybody has different interpretation on what is the right risk tolerance...
16:47:29 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	You'll learn about the Abilene Paradox in BADM 509, where a bunch of people do something because nobody wanted to speak about.
16:47:40 From  Daniel Lien  to  Everyone:
	Hierarchy usually doesn‚Äôt have enough ‚Äúinclusiveness‚Äù in the decision making process. The younger or newer people in team are not encouraged to speak up in this culture.
16:47:41 From  Ashly Bogle  to  Everyone:
	+1 Adam
16:47:52 From  Geoff Masson  to  Everyone:
	@ William - I agree with this, less hierarchy leads to more input which can make for slower/less decisive decisions. But maybe also more consideration of risk with more diverse viewpoints.
16:47:55 From  Koffi Guidi  to  Everyone:
	without hierarchy there is no leadership. Good Hierarchy will require continuous  leadership.
16:48:00 From  Christopher Dodd  to  Everyone:
	@adam 100%
16:48:01 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	William - awesome! - and what do you think about your question - have you seen this in context?
16:48:03 From  Darrell Kisselburgh  to  Everyone:
	@William - most definitely.  I think a voice for each level of the hierarchy should cover the concerns for each level
16:48:04 From  April Ladwig  to  Everyone:
	@william ‚Äîthink about how many teams you may have been apart of where no decision has been made because everyone has a different view
16:48:08 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Adam - pluralistic ignorance -- great piece of learning from 509!
16:48:09 From  Harish Bannai  to  Everyone:
	More Hierarchy would cause confusion and at time it may be demotivating. On the other hand, we can have accountability.
16:48:11 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	Love bringing culture into the mix on this Professor.
16:48:12 From  Saif Ali Kheraj  to  Everyone:
	Decision-making introduces uncertainty as well, and it is up to the leader to adopt the decision path that will reduce risk to the greatest extent possible. What a leader can do is divide his group into segments, with each segment containing a different variety of abilities that complement one another. ¬† In this way leader can create representative from each division.
16:48:37 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	My experience s that it is absolutely probable for people to fail to make make decisions because of information overload - both individually and in teams.
16:48:42 From  Kirk Bogle  to  Everyone:
	+1 Brian. It seems like in Himalayan expeditions, lives may be acceptable externalities for reaching the summit, morbid as that is :-)
16:48:47 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	and that‚Äôs why we need to balance
16:48:48 From  Michael Personius  to  Everyone:
	@koffi Absolutely
16:48:57 From  Michael Thompson  to  Everyone:
	In this case there would need to be at least one or two individuals who would "lead" or be at the top of the hierarchy. The experienced climbers would need to take the lead and be able to judge the condition and relative skill of the other climbers. They'd have to measure the benefit of success versus the cost of failure. 
16:48:57 From  Aarti Lakhani  to  Everyone:
	Hierarchical organizations, while they have clear decision makers and create accountability, they can be less agile and create conflict because there is less delineation
16:49:08 From  Corin Gamgort  to  Everyone:
	You can use the hierachy with your own decision making as well so you do not focus on decisions/action that will not be impactful. 
16:49:13 From  Alexandra Duston  to  Everyone:
	@aarti, excellent point!
16:49:25 From  Nicolas Ferrara  to  Everyone:
	In the decentralized team, there is certainly more inclusiveness-which is a positive.  The challenge is balancing inclusiveness in our roles (which likely include a decent amount of hierarchies). This is where representative inclusiveness includes a practical solution to including everyone's ideas and experiences into the decision making process.
16:49:34 From  Morgan Schwenn  to  Everyone:
	Ideally before a big trip like this a leader would build trust, like in an ER or military. However, these Everest trips are often a group of strangers who hired a guide. This can create chaos. There is also a great book "in to thin air" which addresses group dynamics on these guided trips
16:49:34 From  Yash Sunil Gugale  to  Everyone:
	love this point Harish!
16:49:35 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	Well the Holacracy structure is very interesting, which allows more decision making among the employees themselves
16:49:37 From  Cynthia Abrego  to  Everyone:
	Our group also discussed the balance of hierarchy and culture.  People have to feel comfortable speaking up and feeling they can also influence a better approach
16:49:42 From  Venkata Komaragiri  to  Everyone:
	It‚Äôs all about the trust and confidence on the leader to make the decisions for the team in high risk environments. Leaders will be more responsible in making the right decisions.
16:49:43 From  Alexandra Turcios  to  Everyone:
	^ not only is it representative, it encourages ownership and increased productivity - adding to Michael‚Äôs point
16:49:54 From  Jessi Tamir  to  Everyone:
	I worked for a company that had a hierarchy but claimed that they believed ideas came from everywhere and that they didn't care about the hierarchy...the idea was good in theory, but what we found in practice is that they put us in these equal teams, but those teams had to present all work/decisions back to a "lead team" and the lead team made the decisions anyway despite what was recommended and it actually caused more problems than if they had just left the hierarchy in place.
16:49:57 From  Sean Chen  to  Everyone:
	Decision making efficiency v.s. effectiveness.
16:49:58 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	I think the hierarchal organizational method will lead to a greater vulnerability to success and failure based on the expertise on the person on the top. Think George Washington vs Custer.
16:50:11 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Nicolas - nice connection to Coursera content!
16:50:27 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	In extreme situation you have to relly on experience of your leader and act fast when needed. Often there is no time for disscussions
16:50:33 From  Darrell Kisselburgh  to  Everyone:
	There is a great short video on YouTube that puts context to leader vs boss
16:50:38 From  Darrell Kisselburgh  to  Everyone:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4STpxwBtBU
16:50:46 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Thanks for sharing Darrell
16:50:48 From  Fayaz Rasheed  to  Everyone:
	Hierarchy has both positive and negative effects. We have to leverage the perspectives of different experts which helps leaders make a informed decision.
16:50:48 From  Nikul Thakkar  to  Everyone:
	Hierarchy decision making focuses on the objective but will understand there is a necessary ‚Äúopportunity cost‚Äù which means they may have more leeway for safety. The flat organization will potentially have too many decision makers and won‚Äôt come to a decision soon so will lose the time to summit sooner.
16:50:50 From  Rachel Nixon  to  Everyone:
	Group 1 - hierarchical groups understand that some will not make the summit but accept that some will be lost in the pursuit of the goals
16:51:11 From  Omeed Adham Sindy  to  Everyone:
	Hierarchical is mostly needed since psychologically I believe based on personalities certain people are more likely to be leaders and certain people are likely to be followers.
16:51:13 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	Did any one ever got demotivated because hierarchy included too may leaders and only few people to execute the actual work?
16:51:26 From  Pamela Da Mata Lima  to  Everyone:
	Thinking about climbing and having hierarchy brings to mind the communication piece, if we do not have a leader who brings inclusiveness within the decisions, it might be hard. People might not want to climb up to the top.
16:51:32 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Of course, Velineni! Good question
16:51:36 From  Choon Ling Tay  to  Everyone:
	From another BADM508 Contingency Theories / Approach can be a solution. Combine different structures and tools to minimize the cons.
16:51:37 From  Jessi Tamir  to  Everyone:
	Velineni - I definitely have experienced moments like that
16:51:42 From  Nabil Ali  to  Everyone:
	I like the comment about accountability from Harish. I think without a designated leader, factions can form. Maybe even a committee would work in this case? Instead of one singular person make the calls, we have a group of people?
16:51:44 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	That is very common that there are way to many leaders with not enough works.
16:51:47 From  Rob Travis  to  Everyone:
	Hierarchical organizations or teams are better able to keep the main goal of the exercise in focus.  Without hierarchy you are more likely to bog down in decision points that delay projects.  For better or for worse, decisions need to be made to move a team or business forward.  Sometimes the wrong choice is made and it costs negative customer experience, but through team collaboration and experience, the more likely to achieve success = reaching the summit (and living!).
16:51:48 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	These comments are highlighting the challenge of finding this balance
16:51:57 From  Dustin Smith  to  Everyone:
	Delegation/decentralization works well with high performing teams
16:52:12 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Loida‚Äôs question goes back to this question from Suresh about the definition of success and the group values
16:52:13 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	That makes sense in the context of any one wanting to move up, everyone wants to be the person giving the orders than those who have to carry them out
16:52:28 From  Chelsea Doman (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	Likewise, Loida. Was there a discussion of expectations? Did everyone expect to accomplish this personally instead of the overall accomplishment by the excursion team?
16:52:31 From  Nikul Thakkar  to  Everyone:
	+1 - Yes success factor needs to be defined
16:52:35 From  Jekeia Robinson  to  Everyone:
	Good point - Loida!
16:52:39 From  Michelle Palys  to  Everyone:
	The challenge with hierarchical structures is the delayed decision-making what could be inefficient, or lead to death in the climbers case.
16:52:46 From  Elena Juarez  to  Everyone:
	I agree Loida!
16:52:48 From  Jay Viswanathan  to  Everyone:
	Great point, different goal
16:52:49 From  Xin Guo  to  Everyone:
	Good point Dustin
16:52:50 From  Jessi Tamir  to  Everyone:
	And...to tie to real world...did the leader change the success metric after the mission? LOL.
16:52:51 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	+ 1 Loida. Excellent take :)
16:52:52 From  Rita Hokstad  to  Everyone:
	Mindset
16:52:54 From  Jon Warren  to  Everyone:
	Definitely agreed on that. Clear goals need to be defined from the onset.
16:52:56 From  Christopher Dodd  to  Everyone:
	Definitely agree!'
16:52:57 From  Suresh Krishnan  to  Everyone:
	+1 Loida
16:52:58 From  Anupama Verma  to  Everyone:
	A hierarchy is important because the leader of the team would find a right mix of people with different skills to create a safe environment for the climbers. And right communications and freedom to voice should be encouraged. Even includes freely expressing your gut feeling. So finding the right balance of people, communication, skills and a sense of achieving the common goal is important
16:53:01 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	lol - good question Jessi
16:53:03 From  Melissa Majid  to  Everyone:
	I assumed that the hierarchy would be more successful since tasks would be clear. As we discussed further, it took us to viewing hierarchy as causing people on the bottom to not have the opportunity to develop this skills fully.  Also in some cultures, there are people at the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù and are just resigned to be there. This was related to people who go to work just for the paycheck.
16:53:05 From  Alicia Sale  to  Everyone:
	Sometimes I feel like the leaders have so much attributed to them, it could have merely been the closer you got to the top the worse the conditions and some people slipped, completely out of the leaders control
16:53:13 From  Ozzie Alaniz  to  Everyone:
	Inherent risks in climbing to the top, certainly risks involved with reward
16:53:13 From  Christine Desousa  to  Everyone:
	I think everyone on the team needs to feel supported as Loida just pointed out.  The "bottom" of the team can often times be the backbone of an organization.  But if they aren't being heard or supported, you will eventually fail.
16:53:16 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	It's all people dependent. Some people are just terrible managers/leaders, example is they go with the full "Head" that we learned from Coursera, but lack all the Heart... Others it's a Country Club lounge. Every scenario is unique and a great leader in Org1 might be terrible in Org2.
16:53:18 From  Nikul Thakkar  to  Everyone:
	+1 - Yes, who is in the group matters in this decision as well
16:53:19 From  Neil Prince  to  Everyone:
	definition of success in this case will define the motivation factors of every possible scenario
16:53:19 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	So many great comments and pointers
16:53:23 From  Darrell Kisselburgh  to  Everyone:
	@jessi - LOL
16:53:24 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Also - back to Prof Loyd‚Äôs point - how do we craft hierarchy that is also inclusive?
16:53:26 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	What if the person that died was pushing themselves beyond their limits without communicating with the leadership
16:53:34 From  Venkata Komaragiri  to  Everyone:
	Anyone observed hierarchy structure within innovative organizations?
16:53:34 From  Saif Ali Kheraj  to  Everyone:
	We have practises for each area in our organization, and members from each practise can establish a scrum to work on a specific use case. This results in more diversity and information. This also develops an individual's skill set, which inherently encourages and motivates¬†them.
16:53:38 From  Corin Gamgort  to  Everyone:
	Same to you !!!
16:53:39 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	do you have a "win at any cost" leader or "winning is surviving" leader?
16:53:39 From  Suresh Krishnan  to  Everyone:
	@Jessi LOL. You‚Äôve been reading too much 1984 üòÄüòÄ
16:53:46 From  Vikas Singh  to  Everyone:
	Understanding each team member's personality and understanding their strengths/weaknesses is essential. Also, having a clear communication with the team on contingencies is critical for success.
16:53:52 From  Michael Thompson  to  Everyone:
	The leader(s) has to understand the abilities of those under them. The group may WANT to push ahead and believe that they can but in a life or death situation the leader(s) needs to be able to make those calls. 
16:53:58 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	I think people confusing "boss" and "leader". If you getting ignored - you working with the boss
16:54:07 From  Morgan Schwenn  to  Everyone:
	reminds me of my first 14er attempt with my bf. We picked a 13 mile hike after 10 days of hiking. We hit 13k feet & I was concerned that I would struggle on the way back. My bf would have loved to summit, but we turned around b/c we agreed we would do the hike together. (Needless to say we did do another 14er on a different trip ;))
16:54:10 From  Hermes Pasquez  to  Everyone:
	Definitely agreed on that‚Ä¶ different POV (Point of Views) and the a defined goal to get to the top!
16:54:11 From  Jessi Tamir  to  Everyone:
	LOL Or --- living in the world of marketing where our projects had one goal at onset and magically a different goal when the project was over.
16:54:19 From  Melissa Majid  to  Everyone:
	BIG caveat. lol
16:54:19 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	Since I'm in the sciences, yes, we do change our definition of success constantly after the fact and redefine the entirety of the experiment and success criteria.
16:54:21 From  Victor Febres  to  Everyone:
	leader > manager > boss
16:54:28 From  Rachel Nixon  to  Everyone:
	people at the bottom have more people pushing them to reach the goal but not necessarily motivating the bottom level to achieve.
16:54:33 From  Paul Witte  to  Everyone:
	I wonder if it's a matter of hierarchy only or also authoritarian team culture--in addition to [ill-conceived] success > human life goals.
16:54:34 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	+1 Denise (it's a condition of the climb) :)
16:54:36 From  April Ladwig  to  Everyone:
	@Rob that is one downfall to having a hierarchy without trust. Those that did not make it probably did not feel safe to speak up or disagree with what was happening
16:54:56 From  Michael Janicki  to  Everyone:
	In a strong hierarchical team, if the leader is qualified, you can reach the top.  If the leader is not qualified, you can die.  In a non-hierarchical team, group decision making may not get you to the top, but you are more likely to survive.
16:54:57 From  Choon Ling Tay  to  Everyone:
	Boss - Time Teller, Leader - Clock Builder
16:55:18 From  Yash Sunil Gugale  to  Everyone:
	Professor Loyd, that makes me think, what about underlying unsaid goals? Maybe it may so happen that each team member might not explicitly say what their goal is, but they might have their own individual agenda. How do leaders detect/find that? And lead efficiently in that scenario?
16:55:22 From  Melissa Majid  to  Everyone:
	+1 Choon
16:55:38 From  Chintamoni Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	It depends on organizational structure.
16:55:40 From  Jonathan Valladares Salazar  to  Everyone:
	A person that has Ability to positively influence people and systems to have a meaningful impact and achieve important goals.
16:55:44 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	can you not hear me? I'll log back in.
16:55:51 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	BRB
16:56:00 From  Rita Hokstad  to  Everyone:
	Did not hear you talking Kari
16:56:02 From  Loida Valentin  to  Everyone:
	A leader can also design ways for the weaker or lesser experienced to opt out and voice ‚Äòdissent‚Äô, and/or stop ‚Äògracefully‚Äô to help people save face. A leader should design ways to relieve the pressure and minimize collateral damage
16:56:09 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	The point is to make it as a team, but if one of the people in the group is not capable or unwilling to make it, then they will most likely be left behind
16:56:12 From  Purna Nallabothula  to  Everyone:
	Success with Hierarchical Model with least deaths needs a well-balanced Rational System vs Natural System in the Organization (a concept discussed in BADM 509).
16:56:28 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	+1 Loida
16:57:04 From  Nabil Ali  to  Everyone:
	Would a committee help address the negatives listed? Formed by a few delegates who can represent the low ranking members?
16:57:22 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	I'm back (I think). 
16:57:39 From  Morgan Schwenn  to  Everyone:
	@nabil representative inclusivity!
16:57:45 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	That is the whole point of unions, but they get corrupted.
16:58:00 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	Great Leaders account for those negatives and push others under them and above them to focus on accounting for those negatives. Listen to your juniors. Validate others. Understand that if you know the most in the room you are in the wrong room.
16:58:00 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Morgan good connection to Coursera content. 
16:58:04 From  Chandran Ramasamy Sadasivam  to  Everyone:
	Is less transparency in hierarchy?
16:58:30 From  Ahmed Alshaer  to  Everyone:
	Will we get a copy from the presentation?
16:58:42 From  Saif Ali Kheraj  to  Everyone:
	leaders build self-propelled high-performing teams.. It all basically comes down to having the correct framework in place that operates automatically and that each employee is self-motivated.
16:58:50 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	Corruption- too much power can lead to dictatorial mindset
16:58:50 From  Mee-Hyoe Koo  to  Everyone:
	I think it is easier for colleagues to sabotage each other in a hierarchy-centric organization rather than non-hierarchy organizational structure.
16:58:57 From  Nick Gavrilos  to  Everyone:
	Shes Back!
16:59:57 From  Michael Personius  to  Everyone:
	As the saying goes: Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
16:59:59 From  Mee-Hyoe Koo  to  Everyone:
	Even with start-ups though, with increased investment funding and increasing size (eventually) -- can you honestly say that it is a flat, non-hierarchical structure? Perhaps it is just a fact of life -- and something that we cannot change or influence -- ?
17:00:16 From  Chintamoni Ghosh  to  Everyone:
	Negatives effects: less social engagement, innovation, creativity and ambition.
17:00:20 From  CA2: Zhandos Zhanserikov (eLearning)  to  Everyone:
	@Ahmed, you can find it here after the last live session on Thursday: https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/16327/pages/live-sessions-and-office-hours
17:00:20 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	+1 Mee-Hyoe
17:00:52 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	+1 Mee-Hyoe
17:01:00 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	The boss writes the paycheck
17:01:04 From  Ahmed Alshaer  to  Everyone:
	Thanks Zhandos
17:01:08 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Research on both chimps and humans shows that we actually crave hierarchy. If you put a bunch of people into a room and give them a problem, they will often sort themselves into a sort of hierarchy. The challenge is overcoming those negatives that Prof Loyd highlighted
17:01:21 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	I and others learned quickly at a previous company, that the Director we reported to didn't know as much as us in certain aspects. They needed employees who look up to and worship them, and couldn't be questioned no matter how wrong they were, since they were the Hierarchical Manager (definitely not a leader) and made sure everyone in the group knew it.
17:01:21 From  CA2: Zhandos Zhanserikov (eLearning)  to  Everyone:
	You are welcome!
17:01:42 From  Michael Thompson  to  Everyone:
	The leader of the climbing group not only needs technical expertise and experience but also a sufficient degree of empathy and inclusivity. 
17:01:53 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Michael - yes! And don‚Äôt we all
17:01:54 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	so true Prof.Luckman
17:02:00 From  Corin Gamgort  to  Everyone:
	Good leaders surround themselves with good people.... 
17:02:18 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	Prof Luckman I think that happens because of innate desire to avoid conflict for some and encourage efficiency. water flows through the path of least resistance.
17:02:19 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Tina Fey says her leadership advice is ‚ÄúHigher great people and then get out of their way"
17:02:23 From  Mee-Hyoe Koo  to  Everyone:
	I was reminded of Lord of the Flies sometimes at work...
17:02:29 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	@Professor Luckman - Absolutely crave hierarchy. I see it play out in our courses and small groups in we work in.
17:02:31 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Aaron - yes completely agree. And a desire to avoid or take responsibility
17:02:36 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Rob - interesting! Yes!
17:02:55 From  Roderick Mendoza  to  Everyone:
	But even if the leader had experience or was an expert, doesn't mean they cannot make a mistake, and in a hierarchical culture, the leader's decision will be less questioned which can lead to disaster
17:02:57 From  Jessi Tamir  to  Everyone:
	I mentioned during our breakout that I had some friends at Zappos when they went to a no hierarchy structure. Most of them took the deal to leave...they felt that suddenly they had no career path forward. It was interesting. It would seem being your own boss or having no boss would be appealing but it also made people very uncomfortable (to Prof. Luckman's note on humans craving hierarchy)
17:03:12 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Roderick - yes and learning to make mistakes well is an important leadership competency
17:03:35 From  Aarti Lakhani  to  Everyone:
	Interesting book - Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. How humans need to get to a critical mass in a group and hierarchy forms and is actually looked upon as positive and necessary
17:03:35 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Jessi - Zappo‚Äôs is fascinating - so great in theory but the wholacracy thing really didn‚Äôt work out in practice
17:03:39 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	@Jessi - so almost like the hierarchy as motivator.
17:03:39 From  Paul Witte  to  Everyone:
	Anyone care to share their leadership role models?
17:03:47 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	+1 Paul - good question!
17:03:50 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Mr Rogers
17:03:51 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	üôÇ
17:03:54 From  Denise Lewin Loyd  to  Everyone:
	Great connection @Jessi. 
17:04:00 From  Hermes Pasquez  to  Everyone:
	that might be an influencer
17:04:21 From  Eric Shannon  to  Everyone:
	my leadership role models are all personal to me. my grandfather, my pastor, and my mentor
17:04:31 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	@Paul - Jon Spoelstra
17:04:32 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	+1 Eric - and that is often the best place ot look
17:04:34 From  Jon Warren  to  Everyone:
	Charisma is definitely a good thing for a leader.
17:04:40 From  Rachel Nixon  to  Everyone:
	Influencers have too much referent power, sometimes perceived as experts but not necessarily
17:04:40 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	Zappos is almost unique case. Average age of the employees is 29. At this age you still want to be "with the crowd"
17:04:41 From  Suresh Krishnan  to  Everyone:
	@Aarti: good point and great book.
17:04:43 From  Michael Donkor  to  Everyone:
	Referent power - someone who can greatly influence
17:05:02 From  Benjamin Arthur  to  Everyone:
	Which power are people more likely to follow?
17:05:03 From  Melissa Majid  to  Everyone:
	Does referent power include empathy?
17:05:07 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Natalia - yes - excellent point
17:05:18 From  Anupama Verma  to  Everyone:
	Knowledgeable and likable - personal power üôÇ
17:05:24 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	@Paul Witte - one leadership role model was a captain in the Marine corps. we were in the field for a while doing a communication exercise. at the end when we got what we needed to. He bought pizza for everyone. When I asked him why he said " that is why officers get more money. So we can better provide for those under us. Great Leader.
17:05:25 From  Vikas Singh  to  Everyone:
	One of my leadership role model is Steve Jobs
17:05:27 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	YES! Lead where you stand
17:05:30 From  Ciara Leahy  to  Everyone:
	I think so Melissa, because couldn't you say that empathy is perceived?
17:05:38 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Michael - wait til you see an upcoming slide!
17:05:46 From  Michael Personius  to  Everyone:
	@Benjamin It depends on how much you want to be liked by the people following you
17:05:56 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	Reminds me of the concept of reverse mentoring
17:05:58 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Benjamin people are more likely to follow referent and expert power. 
17:06:02 From  Choon Ling Tay  to  Everyone:
	Both referent and expert is personal bases that we can build along the career.  Reward, legitimate, coercive are positional base.
17:06:11 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Another leader I admire that you would all know - Dean Brown. He has led us through the pandemic with integrity and authenticity - but also has made decisions based on his expertise that support his teams
17:06:13 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	INFORMATIONAL POWER (Game of Thrones: "Little finger" or Lord Varys - the master of whispers)
17:06:18 From  Paul Witte  to  Everyone:
	@Aaron Alvarez very cool example, and very uncommon!
17:06:43 From  Koffi Guidi  to  Everyone:
	I like the way Prof Kari categorize the power in 2 groups: Position in Personal.
17:06:44 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	@Talal - great example
17:06:48 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	Most leaders I have seen use their coercive power way to much. Expert power should be more powerful than it is, great example is the scientist postion.
17:06:49 From  Kirk Bogle  to  Everyone:
	@Talal yes!
17:07:03 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Deric - agree. Coercive power also tends to be used by ‚Äúfearful‚Äù leaders
17:07:13 From  Elizabeth Luckman  to  Everyone:
	Those who fear losing face, losing respect, etc.
17:07:16 From  Aarti Lakhani  to  Everyone:
	Interesting recent experience - how the absence of (personal) power but having legitimate power was used to remove personal power and create different hierarchy
17:07:51 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Talal so glad you brought that up. Informational Power is a debatable "6th" type of power that researchers have posited. Access to information can be a source of real power. 
17:07:53 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	A really great leader has expert power or referent power
17:08:02 From  Loida Valentin  to  Everyone:
	I‚Äôm glad that we are also discussing the ‚Äòdotted-line‚Äô use cases. Even in The Godfather there was the role of The Consigliere.
17:08:08 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	Ignore the perspectives - have seen it happen many times :-)
17:09:00 From  Vikas Singh  to  Everyone:
	This is a good exercise so see what your own power perspective is.
17:09:27 From  Anupama Verma  to  Everyone:
	Actively pursue rewards - may not be their motivation to lead? Could it be following their heart and passion?
17:09:54 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	Great book on leadership. - Maxwell - 360 degree leader . I give it to all of my junior leaders. Lead up, lead down, and lead across.
17:10:10 From  Michael Thompson  to  Everyone:
	The "Stanford Prison Experiment" is a great case study on the consequences of power. 
17:10:26 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	I love "Lie to me"!
17:10:37 From  Lawrence Saheed  to  Everyone:
	lordy this is me
17:10:38 From  Loida Valentin  to  Everyone:
	This is fascinating about the letter ‚ÄòE‚Äô and the POV and relation to power. It makes me wonder: how many of us are using the ‚Äòmirror‚Äô feature for Zoom Self-View or not? ;)
17:10:39 From  Venkata Komaragiri  to  Everyone:
	Maxwell 360 degree leader, great book recommendation
17:10:41 From  Sean Chen  to  Everyone:
	I wonder how much "Feeling powerful " has to do with individual personality type?
17:10:45 From  Jessi Tamir  to  Everyone:
	@Anupama I think this means when someone feels powerful, they might be more likely to ask for a raise or promotion than someone who doesn't feel powerful - not necessarily the motivation.
17:10:58 From  Chelsea Doman (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	On the flip side, there are several recent articles discussing why empathy is so crucial as a leader.
17:11:06 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	Don't be a "mic hog", share the air! :)
17:11:10 From  Mee-Hyoe Koo  to  Everyone:
	Sometimes, in a hierarchy-centric organization, most power is not given to the most knowledgable or the most likeable or most capable or 'with most given hierarchical power' but to someone who has been with the organization for a long time.... often, those individuals end up having the most power with staff.
17:11:27 From  Morgan Schwenn  to  Everyone:
	Power isn't necessarily about being a leader. Power also has to do with power over your personal & professional life
17:11:35 From  Ozzie Alaniz  to  Everyone:
	why do people who are wealthy feel empowered?
17:11:37 From  Michael Personius  to  Everyone:
	With great power comes great responsibility -Ben
17:11:38 From  Yash Sunil Gugale  to  Everyone:
	Leadership shouldn't be forceful though. That leads to bitterness. No leader should try to lead in a way they would themselves hate to see in that position of decision making. I think leadership is really backwards. It's about the well-being of the people and working together rather than commanding power. Basically, don't try to be a leader. When you put the betterment of others in all efforts, you naturally come out as a leader. What does everyone think?
17:11:38 From  Suresh Krishnan  to  Everyone:
	With great power comes great responsibility üòÄüòÄ
17:11:40 From  Irfan Sarwar  to  Everyone:
	actively pursue rewards meaning more of a go-getter
17:11:47 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:
	That is interesting to say that our hierarchy position limits are built in intrinsic ability to genetically recognize facial features
17:11:53 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	+1 Suresh. Love that quote
17:12:06 From  Roderick Mendoza  to  Everyone:
	In the psychological consequences of power, are there cultural differences? Are these results based on western culture?
17:12:11 From  Kevin Smith  to  Everyone:
	I can see how these power dynamics are crucial to fostering inclusive teams.
17:12:20 From  Jonathan Valladares Salazar  to  Everyone:
	"Either find a way to succeed or make one." ‚Äì Suzie Hoyt
17:12:24 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	The best managers don't have to be the smartest in the room, they need to be able to find and lead the smartest in the room. It's a crucial skill. There's also the WAIT concept "Why A I Talking?" of knowing when to speak.
17:12:30 From  Chelsea Doman (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	+1 Kevin
17:12:36 From  Anupama Verma  to  Everyone:
	When we say ‚Äòthey have trouble reading emotions‚Äô - could this be the reason they struggle with inclusiveness?

	You all are bringing up excellent questions and ideas. Keep this discussion going with one another on the Canvas discussion assignment.

	Fail Well!
17:24:38 From  Rita Hokstad  to  Everyone:
	Fail fast, fail cheap
17:24:40 From  Venkata Komaragiri  to  Everyone:
	Communication plays major role, leaders often ignore this when trying to deliver, not providing the context/rationale behind the decison
17:24:41 From  Shahid Rameez  to  Everyone:
	Less malleable to self change (you exclude yourself from change as you feel you are responsible for changing others) and tendency to not own failures
17:24:50 From  Saravanen Marimuthu  to  Everyone:
	Listen first, talk later
17:24:50 From  Rachel Nixon  to  Everyone:
	In my group we thought the leader will continue to lead based on their personal work ethic before becoming a leader.
17:25:02 From  Jack Pennuto  to  Everyone:
	be aware of how people experience your actions and decisions, that will override your intentions

17:25:44 From  Margie Kerber  to  Everyone:
	Be mindful of how your stress impacts your teams. It can be felt.
17:25:47 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Helmut yes That's Sophie! Wait til you meet her brother Einstein!
17:25:52 From  William Rodgers  to  Everyone:
	Depends on the situation....emergency situation there is not time to get everyone's input.
17:25:54 From  Michael Thompson  to  Everyone:
	Insecurity in someone in a leadership role is the enemy of inclusivity. 
17:26:04 From  Paul Witte  to  Everyone:

17:26:16 From  Christopher Dodd  to  Everyone:
	@paul LOL
17:26:17 From  Michael Donkor  to  Everyone:
	I agree but humility needs to come first
17:26:23 From  Nikul Thakkar  to  Everyone:
	We discussed how a leader with too much power will be focused on only the goal without consideration of consequences, like the 1st discussion. They will make sacrifices to make sure their goal is achieved
17:26:45 From  Christine Desousa  to  Everyone:
	A leader must have the emotional intelligence to understand the different personalities and people on their team
17:26:47 From  Michelle Yi Alexander  to  Everyone:
	This class is already therapeutic for me to better understand some of my past bosses/leaders lol
17:26:55 From  Morgan Schwenn  to  Everyone:
	I think people also have subconscious biases that impact what they are empathetic towards
17:26:59 From  Rita Hokstad  to  Everyone:
	Group 18 - we discussed how we show emotions and soft skills. Also, internal threats within an organization.
17:27:01 From  Michael Thompson  to  Everyone:
	Agreed Michelle! 
17:27:06 From  Christine Desousa  to  Everyone:
	@michelle- same!
17:27:07 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	@Michelle - so good to hear :-) 
17:27:07 From  Rachel Sotelo  to  Everyone:
	+1 Michelle
17:27:12 From  Rachel Nixon  to  Everyone:
	Everyday leadership should have some level of empathy which doesn't erode the efficiency.
17:27:15 From  Elena Juarez  to  Everyone:
	Agree professor Loyd!
17:27:16 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	Self-Awareness eliminates Blindspots

	There are so many different ways to fail and a leader that 8 minutes session will not cover it...
17:27:20 From  Alexandra Turcios  to  Everyone:
	Love that professor‚Ä¶ self imposed deadlines can actually hinder motivation and long term growth
17:27:21 From  Aaron Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	@ William, I don't think it matters on time if done correctly. If the crisis situation happened and you didn't understand what everyones inputs should be or could be. That to me indicates a failure on getting to know those on the team adequetly before the crisis situation happened in the first place.
17:27:28 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	Fantastic point Michael Thompson. Someone insecure may not want others in their group exceeding them, and they will lead that way.
17:27:29 From  Nabil Ali  to  Everyone:
	"Good data makes good decisions" - I think to help prevent the consequences from blindspots, a good leader asks others about their take on a certain problem. By getting the data from others on as many scenarios/outcomes as possible, the group can move forward with the best decision possible.
17:27:30 From  Ashly Bogle  to  Everyone:
	+1 Prof Loyd
17:27:33 From  Omeed Adham Sindy  to  Everyone:

	the 3 filters of execution under stress:	1. does it need doing?	2. does it need doing now?	3. does it need doing now by me?
17:27:48 From  April Ladwig  to  Everyone:
	100% agree‚Äî-some people have empathy and others don‚Äôt. It is so important for a leader to have empathy. I have noticed the leaders I know that have more empathy people like working with better
17:27:49 From  Sean Chen  to  Everyone:
	üëç
17:27:52 From  Loida Valentin  to  Everyone:
	Develop a culture where surfacing and identifying blind spots is encouraged ‚Äî making these norms help create psychological safety. This is important when the stakes are high and a high level of quality is needed.
17:27:56 From  Joseph Koetter  to  Everyone:
	don't sacrifice effectiveness for effeciency
17:27:57 From  Anupama Verma  to  Everyone:
	Fear of loosing the Authority and fear of being perceived as weak - some of the blindspots
17:27:59 From  Koffi Guidi  to  Everyone:
	I think a good leader will be the one that believe he/she is "NOT a good leader" and continuous improvement through communication, good listening is the key to handle the blind spot.
17:28:04 From  Joshua Arenson  to  Everyone:
	@William As a rescue specialist even when we have a plan we still listen to suggestions
17:28:12 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:
	Efficiency also differs by culture. 
17:28:14 From  Choon Ling Tay  to  Everyone:
	Sometimes corporation Executive leaders' emphathy is buried by shareholders and investors' pressure.
17:28:22 From  Edysen Shin  to  Everyone:
	Glorification of efficiency. Good one!
17:28:24 From  Rob Totaro  to  Everyone:
	As a team we have to agree on what our core beliefs are. Culture will always win
17:28:24 From  Nilesh Kumar  to  Everyone:
	When i think of the most successful business leaders in today's context Eon Musk, Jeff Bezos,, all seems to have a bit of arrogance, but at the same time welcoming free flow of ideas and thoughts from their bigger team.
17:28:35 From  Saurabh Mishra  to  Everyone:
	From my exp working in Japan, Europe and US now, the efficiency is defined differently :)
17:28:38 From  Rachel Nixon  to  Everyone:
	Yes professor Keating
17:28:40 From  Deric Greger  to  Everyone:

17:29:09 From  Pamela Da Mata Lima  to  Everyone:
	Agreed Omeed!
17:29:15 From  Talal Mahfouz  to  Everyone:
	well said @Omeed
17:29:18 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	Leaders shouldn't "read" you to know what is happening. It's your task to get disagreement to their attention
17:29:23 From  Ezioma Gbujie  to  Everyone:
	I agree with Dr Loyd, during my first year residency the "efficient residents" were praised to the high levels because they "finished" first and went home but checks would indicate their patients tended to get worse and moved to the ICU
17:29:24 From  Alexandra Turcios  to  Everyone:
	Great point‚Ä¶ underestimating threats
17:29:26 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	What I've noticed in the sciences, there's a vast difference in quality between County College and 4-year Professors, in terms of being able to lead a class to success and mentor. In the 4- year school, the career academics often have large egos due to their publications. In the 2-year schools, they often have had careers, succeeded, and want others to now succeed. Just something to think about.
17:29:26 From  CA2: Zhandos Zhanserikov (eLearning)  to  Everyone:
	Deric - you can find them here: https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/16327/pages/module-1-class-engagement-instructions?module_item_id=1450907
17:29:27 From  Kevin Smith  to  Everyone:
	We need to be self aware of the influence/power we hold over others (whether intended or not) and be empathetic and supportive enough to help others recognize the power they have as a member of the team. Everyone has a voice but do they know, or believe, that their input is needed and valued? This is key for inclusiveness.
17:29:27 From  Brian Leung  to  Everyone:
	Agree Saurabh!
17:29:45 From  Kari Keating  to  Everyone:

17:29:55 From  Melissa Majid  to  Everyone:

	Blindspot: Unable to create emotional well-being and increase team productivity.
17:30:17 From  Jessi Tamir  to  Everyone:
	Our group talked about how leaders don't always realize that when they speak first or early that they change the direction of the conversation and may shut down thoughts or conflict. For example, I had a boss who would come in and say "So here's the project we are being asked to do. We need to do this, this, this and this and we should consider this, this and this. Any questions? Can we start brainstorming?" But almost no one would talk because she already drove the entire conversation.
17:30:19 From  Nicolaus Krug  to  Everyone:
	Great class everyone!
17:30:24 From  Denise Lewin Loyd  to  Everyone:
	Where are you Ruth-Ann? I hear the crickets and it makes me think of Jamaica.
