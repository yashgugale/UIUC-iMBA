	It's highly recommended, Andrew.
18:07:48 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	But if you have limited time, then concentrate on the content from this course. Besides, a lot of stuff from that onboarding course is pulled from this course, as I recall.
18:08:03 From  Yuri Pellicane  to  Everyone:
	Could you clarify and/or confirm what EPub and StatPlus will be for this course? Also, How can I find the Add-ins in a Mac should  I purchase EXCEL for Mac?
18:08:22 From  Andrew Huss  to  Everyone:
	Thanks, Vlad
18:09:06 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:

18:09:07 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	@Yuri, there is instruction for Mac at Canvas as a pat of information for module 1

18:09:22 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:

18:09:43 From  Lauren Waryjas  to  Everyone:
	The first assignment that is due next Tuesday, is that similar to the module quizzes? Or will it be an excel we need to submit?
18:09:45 From  Eswar Narava  to  Everyone:
	Statistics always fund to learn
18:09:48 From  Kirk Bogle  to  Everyone:
	@Jay +1

18:10:02 From  Jeffrey Parker  to  Everyone:
	@Jay +1 here also
18:10:27 From  Srinivasulu Malagari  to  Everyone:
	do we need to use only excel ?  can we use other tools (matlab /python...R)
18:10:35 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Lauren - if you go through the ungraded Assignment 1, you will see exactly what needs to be submitted for the graded version.
18:10:38 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Glad I‚Äôm not the only one
18:10:41 From  Nischal Patel  to  Everyone:

	That was my question, too
18:10:56 From  Constanze Kratel  to  Everyone:
	I usually use R to do charts, etc
18:11:04 From  Chandran Ramasamy Sadasivam  to  Everyone:
	for module one home work, do we need to submit the final visual diagrams and summary or we need to submit all the steps and supporting work in pdf
18:11:28 From  Eswar Narava  to  Everyone:
	Any books to suggest from library.
18:11:33 From  Michael Penninger  to  Everyone:
	Power BI the way to go!
18:11:50 From  Yuri Pellicane  to  Everyone:
	Awesome, thank you,  @Prof. Vlad, @ Natalia @Sumit @Kishore for your response
18:11:54 From  Chao-Chuan Wang  to  Everyone:
	For question 6 and 7 of module 1 assignment, what's the expectation on the length of our answers?
18:12:04 From  Srinivasulu Malagari  to  Everyone:
	but some times the answers are off by few digits
18:12:07 From  Gaurav Vasudeva  to  Everyone:
	Any insights on final exam? will it cover all the modules?
18:12:10 From  Srinivasulu Malagari  to  Everyone:
	how this will be handled ?
18:12:15 From  Anupama Verma  to  Everyone:
	There is a video on Canvas on how to convert excel to pdf - somehow that video is not working for me. Should I be emailing to I-support?
18:12:34 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office
18:12:55 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	^^^ Download link
18:13:16 From  Ashish Mody  to  Everyone:
	@ Anupama - essentially go to file save as select pdf... make sure you pay attention to 'selection' vs 'active sheet' etc when you generate the pdf
18:13:18 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Chao-Chuan - a few sentences will do the trick. As long as you answer the question.
18:13:31 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Gaurav: The final exam is cumulative.
18:13:46 From  Chao-Chuan Wang  to  Everyone:
	Thank you Professor.
18:14:12 From  Mercedes Tucker  to  Everyone:
	Given the large amount of students, will office hours work for addressing individual questions?
18:14:14 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Anupama: I suggest trying a different browser at a minimum first; restarting your computer and trying again; and then emailing the support with information/screenshots.
18:14:16 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Uh oh‚Ä¶I totally missed it‚Ä¶where is assignment 1?  Canvas?
18:14:35 From  Sumit Bhagchandani  to  Everyone:
	@Jay - https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/16551
18:14:35 From  Zheng Wang | MLE/DS  to  Everyone:
	Yeah, jay, canvas
18:15:00 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Mercedes: They've worked perfectly fine before; no reason that this time it will be different! Many students will have very similar questions - so just listening to someone else will often solve your issue.
18:15:26 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Jay: Yes, Canvas. You really want to explore Module 1 material thoroughly there.
18:15:36 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:

19:08:47 From  Michael Penninger  to  Everyone:
	They may have surveyed more people from SF than anywhere else - it's definitely suspicious
19:08:51 From  Eric Braxton  to  Everyone:
	$135 isn't the average of the values, it's a comparison point for the cities shown
19:08:56 From  Eric Shannon  to  Everyone:
	"global average"....shows only the US France and UK
19:09:02 From  Jolynn Smith  to  Everyone:
	not enough countries
19:09:05 From  Stephanie McGibbon  to  Everyone:
	The map is not representational 
19:09:13 From  Dan Nolan  to  Everyone:
	Selection criteria for cities, inclusion/exclusion
19:09:15 From  Christine Moore  to  Everyone:
	the data set is not representative of a global population
19:09:15 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	Paris and London in very weird place on the map
19:09:23 From  Peeyush Tripathi  to  Everyone:
	they could have differeetiated different countires via colors
19:09:34 From  Jay Viswanathan  to  Everyone:
	Its not really a globe map
19:09:38 From  Gaurav Vasudeva  to  Everyone:
	no APEC
19:09:41 From  Suresh Krishnan  to  Everyone:
	Sampling bias üôÇ
19:09:46 From  Jolynn Smith  to  Everyone:
	sounds like the news in 2021
19:10:21 From  Natalia Podporina  to  Everyone:
	In other countries IT doesn't get paid
19:11:24 From  Jas Singh  to  Everyone:
	Sorry - my mic did not work earlier.
19:15:10 From  Eric Shannon  to  Everyone:
	IT'S BEAUTIFUL
19:15:11 From  Gaston Gastelum  to  Everyone:
	too busy
19:15:11 From  DJ Premvaree  to  Everyone:
	Those colors hurt my eyes
19:15:18 From  Gene Amdur  to  Everyone:
	looks like abstract art
19:15:20 From  Daniel Hoffmann  to  Everyone:
	slide vomit
19:15:22 From  Amit Aggarwal  to  Everyone:
	too bust
19:15:25 From  Saloni Rane  to  Everyone:
	colors of m&m
19:15:36 From  Amit Aggarwal  to  Everyone:
	sorry, meant to say too busy
19:16:55 From  Priscilla Law Aquino  to  Everyone:
	On histograms, is there some data that can‚Äôt be put into bins?
19:17:38 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	No - histogram contains 100% of your data. The area of the histogram bars is 100%.
19:17:51 From  Yuri Pellicane  to  Everyone:
	That graphic looks like the ECW system for medical records
19:21:46 From  Srinivasulu Malagari  to  Everyone:
	the patterns of the histograms are impacted by the bin size ?
19:21:54 From  Eric Shannon  to  Everyone:
	x axis is independent, y axis is dependent  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
19:22:14 From  Ahmed Alshaer  to  Everyone:
	Will we get a copy from the presentation?
19:22:28 From  Priscilla Law Aquino  to  Everyone:
	Professor said no at the beginning of class
19:22:51 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Srinivasulu: They can be, to a degree - a well-selected bin size is important.
19:23:00 From  Ahmed Alshaer  to  Everyone:
	Thanks Priscilla
19:23:08 From  Gaurav Vasudeva  to  Everyone:
	when we would use "scattered plots"?
19:23:12 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	We do not share the slidedeck, but you can rely on the recording.
19:23:25 From  Ahmed Alshaer  to  Everyone:
	Noted, thanks
19:23:35 From  Srinivasulu Malagari  to  Everyone:
	Prof .  is there a recommended bin size as a thumb rule ?
19:23:36 From  Kathleen St. Louis Caliento  to  Everyone:
	i believe when showing relationship between two variable, @guarav
19:23:51 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	When you are plotting datapoints that show relationship between two variables, and try to figure out trends in this relationship.
19:24:06 From  Abbas Khan  to  Everyone:
	One way to simply the Histogram vs. Bar Graph understanding is to refer to the Module 1 topic of Quantitative data vs. Qualitative data. Qualitative data can be Nominative and Ordinal. Histograms can only be used for Quantitative data. Bar Graphs are used for Qualitative data.
19:24:37 From  Gaurav Vasudeva  to  Everyone:
	thanks @kathleen @vlad
19:24:38 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Is what @abbas said true?
19:25:01 From  Zheng Wang | MLE/DS  to  Everyone:
	Yeah, makes sense
19:25:10 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	Yes, and we've just talked about it too.
19:25:23 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Well that‚Äôs much easier. Thanks @abbas
19:25:50 From  Abbas Khan  to  Everyone:
	yw
19:26:13 From  Molly O  to  Everyone:
	It looked like they had different scales on each though
19:26:17 From  Abbas Khan  to  Everyone:
	and I meant to type *simplify. Sorry for the typo
19:26:56 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	I bet they didn‚Äôt have stats at hogwarts
19:27:07 From  Eric Braxton  to  Everyone:
	They call it "Arithmancy"
19:27:19 From  Adam Scalera  to  Everyone:
	TurnItIn got her
19:27:21 From  Gerald Spencer  to  Everyone:
	Cuckoo's Calling
19:27:22 From  Jas Singh  to  Everyone:
	Way to detect cooked books by looking at the data on the occurrences of digits in the data: https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/story?id=98043&page=1
19:27:22 From  Eric Braxton  to  Everyone:
	only Hermione took it
19:27:23 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Lol @eric
19:27:24 From  Dan Nolan  to  Everyone:
	That is fascinating
19:27:43 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Did Snape teach it?
19:27:52 From  Pawan Upadhyay  to  Everyone:
	Prof Vlad.. What does it mean by characteristics of a histogram? does it mean Range and mode etc.?
19:28:00 From  Eric Braxton  to  Everyone:
	Professor Vector taught it
19:28:03 From  Velineni Rao  to  Everyone:
	Prof Dutta - your passion for data integrity and facts (and question the misleading facts) is very inspiring
19:28:03 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Only muggles need stats.  I wish I were a wizard
19:28:23 From  Dan Nolan  to  Everyone:
	Excel is as close to magic as we are gonna get jay
19:28:31 From  Eric Braxton  to  Everyone:
	lol @ Dan
19:28:32 From  Orlando Nevarez  to  Everyone:
	Jefferson would be thrilled to get credit for writing the Federalist Papers!
19:28:35 From  Noureen Wadhwania  to  Everyone:
	Amazing! üëè
19:28:40 From  Julio Montes De Oca  to  Everyone:
	We are all wizards at heart
19:28:54 From  Vlad Dolgopolov  to  Everyone:
	@Pawan: Is this about Question 6? I think it's about characteristics of the two cities, not the characteristics of the histogram.
19:29:07 From  Jay Tilak  to  Everyone:
	Lol @dan
19:29:13 From  Abbas Khan  to  Everyone:
	Also, the entirety of data in the histogram vs. bar graphs is not the correct way to understand it. Both can be complete data sets. Its the type of data itself (quantitative vs. Qualitative) that dictates which type of statistical graphing to use....
19:29:15 From  Jishad Abubacker  to  Everyone:
	+1 Julio
19:29:21 From  Pawan Upadhyay  to  Everyone:
	ah, ok.. Thanks Prof..

	Whoa! Cool plane, Haixia!
19:30:55 From  Eric Shannon  to  Everyone:
	THANK YOU FOR THE TIME PROFESSOR. I HAVE A HARD STOP NOW. LIVE LONG AND PROSPER
19:30:57 From  Melissa Di Benedetto  to  Everyone:
	Could use histogram in the shoe question if organizing by age (that could be the bin...)
19:30:59 From  Christine DeSousa  to  Everyone:
	I was very nervous about this class, but thank you Professors for making this class very approachable and easing my mind.  I am really looking forward to this class.
